After Paul Atreides (played by Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (played by Rebecca Ferguson) escape from the Harkonnens on Arrakis after being betrayed and attacked, they flee to the planet Caladan.\\n\\nPaul uses his prescience abilities to manipulate events and set in motion a chain of actions that will ultimately lead to his father Leto\\'s death at the hands of Stilgar\\'s warrior group. However, this is not a direct result of Paul\\'s action but rather part of the original plan set by Duncan Idaho.\\n\\nOnce on Caladan, Lady Jessica uses her Bene Gesserit training to teach Paul the ways of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood and to help him understand his own abilities as a messiah figure in the Fremen religion.\\n\\nThe film ends with Paul, now more determined than ever to fulfill his destiny and lead the Fremen in their fight against the ruling powers on Arrakis. He is seen walking away from Caladan towards the planet Arrakis, ready to begin his journey and face the challenges ahead.'"
